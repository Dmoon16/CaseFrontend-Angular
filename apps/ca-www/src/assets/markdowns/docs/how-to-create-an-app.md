4. Click Next.

## Completing app setup

A workflow displays on the next page. Complete the steps to finish setting up your app. You can always return to these pages to edit or update information or your account status.

On the About App page, fill in the company name and website fields (required) and then click Next.

After you submit the form, Case Active displays the Apps page. For each app you create or belong to, the page shows:

1. The app name
2. Your Type (user role)
3. Status

The Apps page is a launching point for many admin functions:

1. Click the APP button to communicate, fill docs, video chat (and more) on case-related issues.
2. Click the ADMIN button to open the admin panel. This is where Admins manage users, cases, integrations, and more.
3. Click the ellipsis to manage account billing and notification settings.

- **Note** Case Active displays the ADMIN button for admin users. Users who do not have admin privileges do not see the ADMIN button (as shown in the screen below).
