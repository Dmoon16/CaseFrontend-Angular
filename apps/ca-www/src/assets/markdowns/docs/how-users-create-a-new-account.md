# How Users Create a New Account

After an admin adds a user to a case:
_ if the user is new to caseactive, the user must complete a workflow to create an account and accept invitation to access the case.
_ if user has an existing caseactive acoount, the user must accept invitation to access the case.

This article describes the steps a user must complete to create their account.

## Getting started

There are two ways a user can be added to a caseactive app

- By admin: If the admin creates a user via the <a href="docs/how-to-create-and-modify-users-with-the-ui" target="_blank">platform UI</a> or <a href="docs/how-to-create-or-modify-cases-with-the-import-tool" target="_blank">Import tool</a>, the admin must send the user a link to account.caseactive.com to proceed to login.
- By user: If the user created an account using a <a href="docs/how-to-create-users-with-a-signup-link" target="_blank">signup link</a>, the user will be automatically be redirected to account.caseactive.com to proceed to login.

## Logging in

When the user logs in to their CaseActive account for the first time, the platform prompts the user to:

- open their email account and then copy/paste the six-digit security code
- complete an account profile

After the user clicks UPDATE, the Apps page displays. The page shows the name of the app (company name), the user type (role), status, and an INVITATION button.
