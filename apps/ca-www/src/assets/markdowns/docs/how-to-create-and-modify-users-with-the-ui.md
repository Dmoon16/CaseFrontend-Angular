# How to Create and Modify Users with the UI

This article shows admins how to create users and update records with the platformâ€™s user interface. Admins can also add users to a new case and edit existing cases.

## Creating a user

1. Log in to the admin account.
2. Locate an app on the Apps page and click the ADMIN button.
3. On the Admin panel, click the Users menu tab.
4. Click the NEW button. A new window displays.

## Modifying a user

To update a small number of user records, use the Edit tool and make changes to each individual user.

- **Note** To modify a large number of user records in one sitting, consider using the <a href="docs/how-to-create-users-with-import-tool" target="_blank">Import tool</a>.

1. On the Admin panel, click the Users menu tab.
2. Locate a user and click Edit.
3. Make changes and click SAVE.

## Next steps

Case Active does not send the user an email notification. Admins should contact the user and send them a link to the Case Active home page. The user then clicks the LOGIN button and completes the workflow for new signups.

- This <a href="docs/how-users-create-a-new-account" target="_blank">article</a> describes the signup workflow for new users.
