Make sure the **Allow Signup** field to set to On. (required)  When enabled, Case Active generates a unique link. 

Review the options below and then click the icon to copy the link. You can place the link on your website or send the link to one or more people via email or any communication channel.

### Case user roles

There are three case user roles.

* clients
* default
* staff


## Sending the link

Share the link with one or more people. Each person clicks the link and completes the workflow to activate their Case Active account. Once the user completes the signup workflow, Case Active adds the user to the Users list.

## Next steps

Case Active sends the user an email notification with the signup link. The user clicks the link and completes the workflow for new signups.
